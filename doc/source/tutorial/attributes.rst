A tour of model attributes
==========================

Several types of attributes are available: integer, string, date, list, set, etc.

In previous example, the `name` attribute is declared as a string by the `default` parameter.

1. Object Id
------------

An unique id is generated by sheraf for each object.


2. Creation Datetime
--------------------

Sheraf stores automagically the creation date of every object when the object is saved:


.. doctest::

    >>> with sheraf.connection(commit=True):
    ...  c = Cowboy.create(name="Calamity Jane")

    >>> with sheraf.connection(commit=True):
    ...  c = next(Cowboy.all())
    ...  #c.creation_datetime() # returns datetime.datetime instance



To be continued...
